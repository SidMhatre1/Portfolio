      <h2>Hello, I'm Siddhesh Mhatre, a Student studying Networking and I.T. Security at Ontario Tech University!</h2>
      <p>I'm into a bit of everything I love to exercise whether it's going outside for a run/hike, or strength training at the gym. I have been playing video games lately my main obsession has been racing games. When it comes to sports I cheer on Ferrari in F1, I'm all about the Leafs in hockey and the Patriots in football. When I'm not gaming or watching sports, you'll find me studying, coding, diving into books, or chilling outdoors with camping, hiking, and motorcycle rides. Also, I like strumming my guitar too when I find the time. Fun Fact about me I'm A United States and Canadian Citizen.</p>
